# ðŸš— Autonomous Driving System using YOLO and Computer Vision

This project is an end-to-end autonomous driving system that integrates multiple modules including lane detection, steering angle prediction, real-time object detection, semantic segmentation, and obstacle avoidance. The goal is to simulate the key components of a self-driving car using deep learning and computer vision techniques.

## ðŸ“Œ Features

- **Lane Detection** using traditional image processing techniques
- **Steering Angle Prediction** using a deep learning model
- **Real-time Object Detection** using YOLO (You Only Look Once)
- **Semantic Segmentation** of road scenes
- **Obstacle Avoidance** based on object detection and distance metrics
